  // Church Leaders
  churchLeaders: {
    email: {
      subject: 'From one church leader to another...',
      body: `Hi [Name],

Church leadership is hard enough without having to become a technology expert too.

I'm David George, pastor at [Church Name] and the founder of something I wish had existed when I started in ministry: FaithTech Blueprint.

After serving in pastoral roles for 10+ years and moonlighting as a software developer, I kept seeing the same pattern: great churches making poor technology decisions not because they lacked wisdom, but because they lacked a framework.

So I built one.

FaithTech Blueprint is the platform I wish every church leadership team had access to:

âœ… 15-minute assessment that reveals your technology blind spots
âœ… Strategic roadmap tailored to your ministry context and budget
âœ… Proven templates from churches that got it right
âœ… Integration guidance for your existing systems

This isn't another piece of church software - it's a strategic partner for technology decisions.

The results from our beta churches speak for themselves:
â€¢ 78% of churches implemented at least three major technology improvements
â€¢ Average technology ROI increased by 245% within six months
â€¢ Administrative time reduced by an average of 12 hours per week
â€¢ Online engagement increased by an average of 89%

I'm offering a free assessment to church leaders in our launch week. No obligation, just actionable insights for your ministry.

[CTA Button: Take Free Assessment]

The assessment takes 15 minutes and gives you a personalized report you can present to your leadership team.

Grace and peace,
David George
Pastor & Founder, FaithTech Blueprint
